  <h3 align="center">Diabetes Classification using KNN</h3>

  <p align="justify">
  Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.<br>
  In this project, we'll be classifying diabetes using Pima Indian diabetes dataset available on Kaggle.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, we'll be classifying diabetes using Pima Indian diabetes dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of 768 rows with 8 characteristics and an outcome, in particular:

    Number of times pregnant.
    Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
    Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
    Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
    2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
    Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
    Diabetes pedigree function
    Age
    Outcome
    
Now, given this dataset, our main task will be to train a machine learning model that is able to classify whether a pregnent woman is diabetic or not.

### Built With
The entire coding part is done using:
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

Important python libraries to be used:
* [numpy](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy)
* [pandas](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pandas)
* [matplotlib](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/matplotlib)
* [seaborn](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/seaborn)
* [sklearn](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/sklearn)




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of python, data visualtisation libraries and K-nearest neighbour technique is required.

### Installation
 
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo.git
```
2. Install Jupyter notebook
3. Install Python packages


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

We'll follow OSEMN Pipeline: 

    O - Obtaining our data
    S - Scrubbing / Cleaning our data
    E - Exploring / Visualizing our data will allow us to find patterns and trends
    M - Modeling our data will give us our predictive power as a wizard
    N - INterpreting our data

After we are able to complete above steps and we have the model, the task at the end will be to tune hyperparameter to optimise our model's performance.
